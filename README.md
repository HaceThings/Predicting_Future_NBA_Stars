As the use of social media increases, many highly ranked high school basketball stars are being recruited out of high school. 
Each year, the RSCI ranks the top high school players each year. Many of these high school players wish to make it to the NBA. 
However, a small percentage of them do. The purpose of this project is to compare how a player performs in high school (RSCI rank) and college and if drafted, a player’s NBA draft position.

This project will gather data of 20,000 basketball players over the past 20 years. The criteria for predicting a player’s future is:
RSCI rank (high school performance)
College performance
Teams’ performance (final ranking) 
Games played
MP - minutes per game
PPG - points per game
RPG - rebounds per game
AST - assists per game
FG% - overall field goal percentage
3PG% - 3-point shooting percentage
FT% - free throw percentage
Draft position
